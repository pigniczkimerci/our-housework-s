# Our housework's

It is an Angular application that helps you keep track of your chores or tasks.


## Installation
Before running the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
Angular CLI (Command Line Interface)

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

#### npm install
Usage
The project comes with several scripts defined in the package.json file, which can be executed using npm.

start: Builds and serves the application in development mode.
build: Builds the application for production deployment.
 
## Starting the Application
To start the application in development mode, run the following command:

#### ng serve
This command will compile the application and start a development server. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200 to access the application.

Any changes you make to the source code will automatically trigger a rebuild, and the browser will reload to reflect the changes.

Building for Production
To build the application for production deployment, use the following command:

#### ng build --prod
This will compile the application and generate optimized production-ready files in the dist directory.
